                    <p>A 2017 review of clinical trials found that drinking coffee is generally safe within usual levels
                        of intake and is more likely to improve health outcomes than to cause harm at doses of 3 or 4
                        cups of coffee daily. Exceptions include possible increased risk in women having bone fractures,
                        and a possible increased risk in pregnant women of fetal loss or decreased birth weight. Results
                        were complicated by poor study quality, and differences in age, gender, health status, and
                        serving size.</p>

            <h1>TYPES</h1>
            <p>Coffee beans are the seeds of a fruit called a coffee cherry. Coffee cherries grow on coffee trees from a
                genus of plants called Coffea. There are a wide variety of species of coffee plants, ranging from shrubs
                to trees.</p><br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Type of bean. </strong>
                        There are two main types of coffee species, Arabica and
                        Robusta. Arabica
                        originates from Ethiopia and produces a mild, flavorful tasting coffee. It is the most
                        popular type worldwide. However, it is expensive to grow because the Arabica plant is
                        sensitive to the environment, requiring shade, humidity, and steady temperatures between
                        60-75 degrees Fahrenheit. The Robusta coffee plant is more economical to grow because it is
                        resistant to disease and survives in a wider range of temperatures between 65 - 97 degrees
                        Fahrenheit. It can also withstand harsh climate changes such as variations in rainfall and
                        strong sunlight.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Type of roast.</strong>
                        Coffee beans start out green. They are roasted at a high heat
                        to produce a chemical change that releases the rich aroma and flavor associate with coffee.
                        They are then cooled and ground for brewing. Roasting levels range from light to medium to
                        dark. The lighter the roast, lighter the color and roasted flavor and the higher its acidity
                        and a bitter roasted flavor. The popular french roast is medium-dark.

                <li>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Type of grind. </strong>
                        A medium grind is the most common and used for automatic drip
                        coffee makers. A fine grind is used for deeper flavors like espresso, releases the oils, and
                        a coarse grind is used in coffee presses.

                        Bill Rosenberg opened Open Kettle in 1948, a restaurant selling donuts and coffee in Quincy,
                        Massachusetts (a suburb of Boston), but he changed the name in 1950 to Dunkin' Donuts after
                        discussing with company executives.[11][12] He conceived the idea for the restaurant after his
                        experiences selling food in factories and at construction sites, where donuts and coffee were
                        the two most popular items.

McCafe proved to be more successful than the fast food chain itself and is the largest coffee chain in Australia and New Zealand.
